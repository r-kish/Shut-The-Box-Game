# Shut The Box Game ðŸ“¦

Welcome to the Shut the Box Game! This game was made in Java for my first year capstone project. The goal of this project was to create a game using arrays completely in Java. Shut the box is a single or multiplayer game that is popular in schools as a math exercise, or in English pubs for gambling.

Rules:
-  The objective of the game is to shut all of the boxes (labeled 1-9)
-  First, a seed is selected for the game.
-  The dice is rolled, and the player must select the box that matches the rolled number, or two boxes whose sum equals that of the dice roll.
-      Example: Dice roll is 7. Player can choose either 7, or any two combinations that sum to 7 (i.e. 5 & 2; 3 & 4; 6 & 1).

-  Points are added on a rolling total each time a box is successfully shut.
-  If there are no boxes, or sum of boxes, available to match the rolled number, the game is over.

-  The game is won when all boxes are successfully shut.

Error Detection: The game has error detection, in case the player enters a combination of boxes that do not match the dice roll, or are not available.
